                            The José Limón Dance Foundation exists to perpetuate the Limón legacy and its humanistic approach to movement and theater, and to extend the vitality of that vision into the future, through performance, creation, preservation and education.
Acclaimed for its dramatic expression, technical mastery and expansive, yet nuanced movement, the Limón Dance Company illustrates the timelessness of José Limón’s work and vision.
Founded in 1946 by José Limón and Doris Humphrey, the Company was guided from 1978-2016 by Carla Maxwell, who worked closely with Limón. She has since become the Foundation’s first Legacy Director, and Colin Connor has assumed artistic leadership. The Company’s repertory, which balances classic works with commissions from contemporary choreographers, is of an unparalleled breadth, creating unique experiences for audiences around the world.
